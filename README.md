# T12 — Checkpoint 2 (Unconstrained Component)

Team T12 · Storyline B (cloud resource allocation) · variant 2 · seed 12

## Roles

Chosen for a team of five, per Section 5 of the instructions (role table).
**Fill in real names before the first commit** — the placeholders below
must become the actual GitHub-linked names before anything is pushed.

| Role | Member | GitHub | Code authored (`src/`) | Analysis section | Hand trace |
|------|--------|--------|-------------------------|-------------------|------------|
| M1 — GD | Tilesbay | [@etilesbay-stack](https://github.com/etilesbay-stack) | `optim/gd.py`, `problems/rosenbrock.py`, `check_grad` | S1 — Step size and stability | H1 |
| M2 — Newton | Rakhima | [@queenbikeshhh](https://github.com/queenbikeshhh) | `optim/newton.py`, `problems/quadratic.py` | S2 — Conditioning, cost and safeguards | H2 |
| M3 — Momentum | Tamerlan | [@Tabix01](https://github.com/Tabix01) | `optim/momentum.py`, `experiments/plots.py` | S3 — Momentum in the valley | H3 |
| M4 — Adam | Danial | [@Haigatu](https://github.com/Haigatu) | `optim/adam.py` | S4 — Adam and the rotated axes | H4 |
| M5 — Project lead | Zere | [@zere90](https://github.com/zere90) | `problems/project.py`, `experiments/run_all.py` (tables), assembling the PDF | S5 — Project block | H5 |

This is our own proposed split; the instructions say "choose the roles
yourselves... write the choice into README.md in your first commit, and
keep it." Change the table above if your team wants a different split —
just do it *before* the first commit, not after.

## How to run

```
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install numpy matplotlib        # matplotlib only needed for plots.py
cd src
python -m experiments.run_all        # regenerates every results/*.csv
python -m experiments.plots          # regenerates results/figures/F1-F3
pytest ../tests -q                   # or: for f in ../tests/test_*.py; do python3 "$f"; done
```

`run_all.py` is deterministic (fixed starts, no randomness) and reproduces
every number behind Table 1 and Table 2, including the hyperparameter
grid search of Section 3. A full run takes a few minutes, mostly spent on
the grid searches for GD/momentum/Adam on R1 and R2 (tens of thousands of
GD iterations per grid cell near convergence).

## Environment

- Python 3.11
- `numpy` (solvers, problems) — the only dependency inside `src/optim/`
  and `src/problems/`, as required by Section 2 ("from scratch").
- `matplotlib` — plotting only (`experiments/plots.py`), as explicitly
  allowed by Section 2.
- `pytest` optional — the test files also run standalone with
  `python3 tests/test_X.py` (see each file's `if __name__ == "__main__"`
  block), no test framework required.
- No `scipy.optimize`, `sklearn`, autograd/JAX/PyTorch anywhere in
  `src/`.
